            FlightsAboveMe uses public aviation data feeds. If you want to go one step deeper, you can also
            <b>receive ADS‑B signals yourself</b> with inexpensive hardware.
            Many community flight‑tracking networks exist because people run small receivers at home.

<h2 style="margin-top:0">What you’ll receive</h2>
<p>
          ADS‑B is a broadcast system. Aircraft transmit messages over radio that can include position, altitude, speed,
          heading, and identifiers. Your receiver simply listens — it does not transmit.
        </p>
<h2>1090 MHz vs 978 MHz (U.S.)</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>1090 MHz:</b> Common worldwide and used by most commercial aircraft.</li>
<li><b>978 MHz (UAT):</b> Mostly U.S. general aviation at lower altitudes.</li>
</ul>
<p>
          If you only choose one, <b>1090 MHz</b> is usually the best first pick for broad coverage.
        </p>
<h2>Starter hardware (three simple tiers)</h2>
<h3>Tier 1 — Quick start (lowest cost)</h3>
<ul>
<li>USB SDR dongle (RTL‑SDR style)</li>
<li>Basic antenna (indoor works, outdoor is better)</li>
<li>Laptop, mini‑PC, or Raspberry Pi</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tier 2 — Better range (best value)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Outdoor antenna mounted higher (attic / roof / mast)</li>
<li>Quality coax cable (reduces signal loss)</li>
<li>Optional filter or LNA (helps in noisy RF environments)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tier 3 — Dedicated 24/7 setup</h3>
<ul>
<li>Weatherproof enclosure + stable power</li>
<li>Grounding/lightning safety considerations</li>
<li>Small always‑on computer and monitoring</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why height matters most</h2>
<p>
          ADS‑B is line‑of‑sight radio. A higher antenna with a clearer view often improves range more than any other single change.
          Even a few extra feet can make a noticeable difference.
        </p>
<h2>What range should you expect?</h2>
<p>
          Range depends on antenna placement, terrain, and nearby radio noise. A simple indoor antenna might see nearby aircraft,
          while an outdoor antenna with a clear view can see much farther — especially for high‑altitude flights.
        </p>
<p>
          If your results seem “thin,” don’t assume it’s broken. Try moving the antenna closer to a window, then later move it outdoors if possible.
        </p>
<h2>Basic setup steps (high level)</h2>
<ol style="margin-top:0">
<li>Connect your SDR and antenna</li>
<li>Install a decoder app (many free options exist)</li>
<li>Confirm you’re receiving messages</li>
<li>Optionally visualize aircraft on a local map or feed a community network</li>
</ol>
<h2>Software options (plain English)</h2>
<p>
          You can run a decoder on a laptop or a small computer. Many people use a Raspberry Pi because it’s low‑power and can run 24/7.
          Some setups are “plug‑and‑play” images you flash to an SD card, while others are simple packages you install.
          The goal is the same: decode ADS‑B messages and display them.
        </p>
<h2>Feeding a community network (optional)</h2>
<p>
          If you choose to contribute your receiver data, you can help improve coverage — especially in areas where fewer antennas exist.
          Networks typically provide setup instructions and may offer premium features in return.
          This is optional; you can also keep your receiver for personal learning only.
        </p>
<h2>Legal and safety notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>This is <b>receive‑only</b>. You are listening to broadcasts — not transmitting.</li>
<li>Use safe mounting practices (ladders, roofs, power lines, weather exposure).</li>
<li>If you contribute data to a network, follow their terms of service.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why this matters to FlightsAboveMe</h2>
<p>
          Community receivers help fill coverage gaps. That’s a big reason live tracking can work in so many places.
          If you’ve ever wondered why data looks thinner in one region than another, receiver density is often the explanation.

<h2 style="margin-top:0">Quick questions</h2>
<h3>Do I need internet for the receiver?</h3>
<p>You can receive and view messages locally without feeding any network. Internet is only needed if you choose to share data or use online maps/services.</p>
<h3>Will this interfere with aviation radios?</h3>
<p>No — a basic ADS‑B receiver is receive‑only. It listens to broadcasts and does not transmit.</p>
<h3>Is it hard?</h3>
<p>Most people can get a first decode running in an hour. Antenna placement is the “secret sauce” for better results.</p>
