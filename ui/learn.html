            FlightsAboveMe shows aircraft flying near your location using live surveillance broadcasts and aviation data feeds.
            The goal is to make “what’s overhead?” easy to understand — without needing to be a pilot.

          <h3>What FlightsAboveMe is showing you</h3>
          <p>
            FlightsAboveMe is built around the same data air traffic systems see: aircraft transponder broadcasts.
            Most of what you see is derived from <b>ADS‑B Out</b> messages (and in some regions, supplemental techniques like <b>MLAT</b>).
            The site is designed for understanding what’s overhead — not for navigation.
          </p>

          <h3>ADS‑B Out vs ADS‑B In</h3>
          <p>
            <b>ADS‑B Out</b> is the broadcast from an aircraft. That’s what tracking networks receive.
            <b>ADS‑B In</b> is a receiver inside an aircraft that can display nearby traffic.
            FlightsAboveMe uses public data networks that collect ADS‑B Out messages.
          </p>

          <h3>1090 MHz vs 978 MHz (UAT)</h3>
          <p>
            Most commercial and international aircraft broadcast ADS‑B on <b>1090&nbsp;MHz</b> (Mode S / “Extended Squitter”).
            In the United States, some general aviation aircraft use <b>978&nbsp;MHz</b> UAT.
            Your local receiver (and some networks) may support both, but 1090&nbsp;MHz is the global standard.
          </p>

          <h3>Why different trackers sometimes disagree</h3>
          <p>
            Two sites can show slightly different positions, altitudes, or callsigns for the same aircraft.
            Differences usually come from receiver coverage (what messages were actually received), timing/latency,
            and how each network cleans and merges data.
          </p>

          <h3>Coverage and “no flights found”</h3>
          <p>
            ADS‑B is line‑of‑sight. Terrain, buildings, and distance affect whether a receiver can hear an aircraft.
            Low‑altitude flights can disappear behind terrain, and remote areas may have limited ground coverage.
            That’s why FlightsAboveMe falls back to a demo area when location is unavailable — so you can still see how it works.
          </p>

<h3>ADS‑B (the main signal)</h3>
          <p>
            <b>ADS‑B</b> stands for <i>Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast</i>. Many aircraft continuously broadcast
            information like position, altitude, ground speed, and an identifier. Receivers on the ground (and sometimes satellites)
            pick up these broadcasts and share them through flight tracking networks.
          </p>

          <h3>Mode S and MLAT (why trackers can differ)</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Mode S</b> is the transponder format used by most modern aircraft and includes a unique aircraft address (ICAO24).
            Not every aircraft broadcasts full ADS‑B position all the time. When position isn’t available, some networks can estimate it using <b>MLAT</b>
            (multilateration) — measuring the time difference of arrival of the same signal at multiple receivers.
          </p>
          <p>
            MLAT can be very accurate when receiver geometry is good, but it depends on coverage.
            That’s one reason an aircraft may appear on one network but not another, or show a slightly different track.
          </p>

          <p>
            Not every aircraft transmits the same level of detail all the time.
            Some transponders report identity (Mode S) but may not include precise GPS position.
            In those cases, some networks estimate position using <b>MLAT</b> (multilateration), which compares the signal timing
            across multiple receivers. That’s one reason two sites can show slightly different tracks.
          </p>

          <h3>Why a plane might not appear</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Coverage:</b> receiver density varies by region.</li>
            <li><b>Equipment/config:</b> not all aircraft broadcast ADS‑B position.</li>
            <li><b>Latency:</b> some feeds are delayed or temporarily missing fields.</li>
            <li><b>Filtering:</b> data sources may filter low-quality or incomplete messages.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>ICAO24 (the aircraft’s hex ID)</h3>
          <p>
            <b>ICAO24</b> is the 6‑character hexadecimal identifier tied to an aircraft’s transponder.
            It’s a stable ID that helps services look up aircraft details like registration and type.
          </p>

          <h3>Callsign vs flight number</h3>
          <p>
            The <b>callsign</b> is what the aircraft uses for air traffic control and surveillance systems (often like <code>DAL123</code>).
            It usually matches the public flight number, but not always — cargo, charter, and private flights can use different formats.
          </p>

          <h3>Altitude, speed, and direction</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Altitude:</b> often barometric (pressure‑based) altitude, not exact GPS height.</li>
            <li><b>Speed:</b> ground speed (wind affects it).</li>
            <li><b>Direction:</b> the track over the ground (can differ from “where the nose points”).</li>
          </ul>


          <h3 id="altitude">How altitude is calculated</h3>
          <p>
            Most altitudes shown by flight trackers come from the aircraft’s transponder as <b>barometric altitude</b> (pressure‑based),
            referenced to standard atmospheric pressure (29.92 inHg / 1013.25 hPa). Air traffic control uses this standardized altitude
            so all aircraft agree on the same reference even as local weather pressure changes.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Barometric vs GPS:</b> baro altitude is not the same as GPS height and can differ by a few hundred feet.</li>
            <li><b>MSL vs AGL:</b> trackers usually show altitude above mean sea level (MSL), not height above the ground (AGL).</li>
            <li><b>Rounding:</b> some feeds round altitude to 25–100 ft increments depending on the message type.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 id="squawk">Squawk codes (transponder codes)</h3>
          <p>
            A <b>squawk</b> is a 4‑digit code set on the aircraft’s transponder (Mode A) so radar and ATC systems can identify and manage aircraft.
            Many squawks are assigned by controllers; some are standard codes used in certain situations.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>7700</b> — general emergency</li>
            <li><b>7600</b> — radio communications failure</li>
            <li><b>7500</b> — unlawful interference (hijacking)</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="learnSmall">

          <h3>Climbing • Descending • Cruising</h3>
          <p>
            FlightsAboveMe labels movement using <b>vertical speed</b> (feet per minute): positive = climbing, negative = descending,
            and near‑zero (or missing) = cruising/level flight.
          </p>

          <h3>Our data sources</h3>
          <p>
            FlightsAboveMe blends multiple sources to improve reliability and add aircraft details:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>OpenSky Network</b> — primary live state vectors when available</li>
            <li><b>adsb.lol</b> — fallback live aircraft state data</li>
            <li><b>AeroDataBox</b> — aircraft enrichment (type/model/operator details)</li>
          </ul>
