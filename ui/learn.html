        FlightsAboveMe displays aircraft overhead using public surveillance broadcasts and aviation data feeds.
        Here’s what you’re seeing, where it comes from, and why it can differ from other trackers.
      </p>

      <section class="learnSection" id="adsb">
        <h2>ADS-B in a nutshell</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>ADS-B</strong> (Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast) is a system where an aircraft
          broadcasts its position, altitude, speed, and identification, typically derived from onboard GPS.
          Anyone with the right receiver (or a data feed that aggregates receivers) can pick up these broadcasts.
        </p>
        <p class="learnNote">
          Coverage varies by region and receiver density, so “what’s overhead” can be missed or delayed in some areas.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="learnSection" id="modes-mlat">
        <h2>ADS-B vs Mode S vs MLAT</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mode S</strong>: transponder messages that identify the aircraft and can include other data, sometimes without GPS position.</li>
          <li><strong>ADS-B</strong>: broadcasts that include GPS-based position (Mode S ES on 1090 MHz or UAT on 978 MHz in the US).</li>
          <li><strong>MLAT</strong> (multilateration): position estimated by comparing signal arrival times at multiple receivers when ADS-B position isn’t available.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Different sources may use different mixes of ADS-B and MLAT, which can cause small differences between flight tracking sites.
        </p>

      <section class="learnSection" id="icao24">
        <h2>What is ICAO24?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>ICAO24</strong> is a unique 6-character hexadecimal identifier assigned to an aircraft’s transponder.
          It’s like a digital fingerprint used to match live broadcasts to aircraft details (type, registration, operator) when available.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="learnSection" id="callsign">
        <h2>Callsign vs flight number</h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>callsign</strong> is what you’ll see in surveillance/radar data and what pilots use on the radio.
          It often resembles a flight number (e.g., DAL123), but it can also be a charter/cargo identifier or a format that doesn’t match public schedules.
        </p>

      <section class="learnSection" id="altitude-speed">
        <h2>Altitude, speed, and direction</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Altitude</strong>: often based on barometric pressure (“baro altitude”), not exact GPS height above sea level.</li>
          <li><strong>Ground speed</strong>: speed over the ground (winds can make it differ from airspeed).</li>
          <li><strong>Track vs heading</strong>: track is the direction of motion; heading is where the nose points.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="learnSection" id="climb">
        <h2>Climbing, descending, and cruising</h2>
        <p>
          FlightsAboveMe uses <strong>vertical speed</strong> (feet per minute) to label the climb state:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Positive vertical speed → <strong>Climbing</strong></li>
          <li>Negative vertical speed → <strong>Descending</strong></li>
          <li>Near zero or missing → <strong>Cruising</strong> (level flight or no reliable vertical speed available)</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="learnSection" id="sources">
        <h2>Where FlightsAboveMe data comes from</h2>
        <p>
          FlightsAboveMe blends multiple sources to improve reliability and fill in details:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>OpenSky Network</strong> – primary live state vectors when available</li>
          <li><strong>adsb.lol</strong> – fallback live aircraft state data</li>
          <li><strong>AeroDataBox</strong> – enrichment (aircraft model/type/operator details)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="learnNote">
          Each source has different coverage and latency. If you see occasional blanks or changes, it’s usually due to upstream availability.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="learnSection" id="limitations">
        <h2>Data limitations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Flight tracking data can be <strong>delayed, incomplete, or temporarily inaccurate</strong>.</li>
          <li>Coverage depends on aircraft equipment and receiver density.</li>
          <li>This site is for <strong>informational purposes only</strong> and is not intended for navigation or operational decisions.</li>
