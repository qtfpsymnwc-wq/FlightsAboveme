            FlightsAboveMe shows aircraft flying near your location using live surveillance broadcasts and aviation data feeds.
            The goal is to make “what’s overhead?” easy to understand — without needing to be a pilot.
          </p>

          <h3>ADS‑B (the main signal)</h3>
          <p>
            <b>ADS‑B</b> stands for <i>Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast</i>. Many aircraft continuously broadcast
            information like position, altitude, ground speed, and an identifier. Receivers on the ground (and sometimes satellites)
            pick up these broadcasts and share them through flight tracking networks.
          </p>

          <h3>Mode S and MLAT (why trackers can differ)</h3>
          <p>
            Not every aircraft transmits the same level of detail all the time.
            Some transponders report identity (Mode S) but may not include precise GPS position.
            In those cases, some networks estimate position using <b>MLAT</b> (multilateration), which compares the signal timing
            across multiple receivers. That’s one reason two sites can show slightly different tracks.
          </p>

          <h3>Why a plane might not appear</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Coverage:</b> receiver density varies by region.</li>
            <li><b>Equipment/config:</b> not all aircraft broadcast ADS‑B position.</li>
            <li><b>Latency:</b> some feeds are delayed or temporarily missing fields.</li>
            <li><b>Filtering:</b> data sources may filter low-quality or incomplete messages.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>ICAO24 (the aircraft’s hex ID)</h3>
          <p>
            <b>ICAO24</b> is the 6‑character hexadecimal identifier tied to an aircraft’s transponder.
            It’s a stable ID that helps services look up aircraft details like registration and type.
          </p>

          <h3>Callsign vs flight number</h3>
          <p>
            The <b>callsign</b> is what the aircraft uses for air traffic control and surveillance systems (often like <code>DAL123</code>).
            It usually matches the public flight number, but not always — cargo, charter, and private flights can use different formats.
          </p>

          <h3>Altitude, speed, and direction</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Altitude:</b> often barometric (pressure‑based) altitude, not exact GPS height.</li>
            <li><b>Speed:</b> ground speed (wind affects it).</li>
            <li><b>Direction:</b> the track over the ground (can differ from “where the nose points”).</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Climbing • Descending • Cruising</h3>
          <p>
            FlightsAboveMe labels movement using <b>vertical speed</b> (feet per minute): positive = climbing, negative = descending,
            and near‑zero (or missing) = cruising/level flight.
          </p>

          <h3>Our data sources</h3>
          <p>
            FlightsAboveMe blends multiple sources to improve reliability and add aircraft details:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>OpenSky Network</b> — primary live state vectors when available</li>
            <li><b>adsb.lol</b> — fallback live aircraft state data</li>
            <li><b>AeroDataBox</b> — aircraft enrichment (type/model/operator details)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Important notice</h3>
          <p class="learnNotice">
            Flight data is provided for informational purposes only and may be delayed, incomplete, or inaccurate.
            Not for operational or navigation use.
