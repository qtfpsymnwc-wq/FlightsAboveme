            A <b>squawk</b> is a four‑digit code set in an aircraft’s transponder.
            Air traffic control assigns these codes to help identify aircraft on their systems.
            Most squawks are routine — like a short ID number tied to a flight’s clearance.

<h2 style="margin-top:0">What a transponder does (quick version)</h2>
<p>
          The transponder is an avionics unit that can broadcast or reply with information used for surveillance.
          Depending on the aircraft and system, it may provide:
        </p>
<ul>
<li>an identification code (the squawk)</li>
<li>pressure altitude (often called Mode C altitude)</li>
<li>enhanced identification features (Mode S)</li>
</ul>
<p>
          FlightsAboveMe uses publicly available live data feeds. If a squawk is present in those feeds, we can show it — or, when it’s one of the big three emergency codes, we show the <b>meaning</b>.
        </p>
<h2>Why most squawk codes are boring (in a good way)</h2>
<p>
          In normal operations, squawks are just part of traffic management:
        </p>
<ul>
<li>Departing flights get an assigned code</li>
<li>Arriving flights get an assigned code</li>
<li>Training flights may use local codes</li>
<li>Some flights use a standard “VFR” code in their region</li>
</ul>
<p>
          Seeing a squawk by itself does not mean anything is wrong. Controllers assign and change squawks all day long.
        </p>
<h2>Common “VFR” codes (examples)</h2>
<p>
          These vary by country/region, but you may see patterns:
        </p>
<ul>
<li><b>1200</b> — Common VFR code in the United States</li>
<li><b>7000</b> — Common VFR code in many European countries</li>
</ul>
<p>
          FlightsAboveMe does not try to interpret every regional code because meanings can differ.
          Instead, we focus on the widely recognized emergency codes below.
        </p>
<h2>The three well‑known emergency codes</h2>
<h3>7500 — Unlawful interference (hijacking)</h3>
<p>
          This is associated with unlawful interference. It’s rare.
          Public trackers may show it, but it’s important not to jump to conclusions — always rely on official reporting.
        </p>
<h3>7600 — Radio communication failure</h3>
<p>
          Indicates the aircraft may have lost radio communications. Pilots and controllers have established procedures for this scenario.
        </p>
<h3>7700 — General emergency</h3>
<p>
          A broad emergency code that can be used for many situations (medical, mechanical, smoke, or other urgent issues).
        </p>
<h2>Why FlightsAboveMe shows meanings (not raw codes)</h2>
<p>
          Raw squawk numbers can be easy to misread. Most are routine and don’t have a simple public “translation.”
          To keep the experience clear and reduce false alarm, FlightsAboveMe focuses on <b>meaning</b> only when a code has a widely understood public interpretation.
        </p>
<h2>Why a squawk might be missing</h2>
<p>
          Sometimes a squawk won’t show up in a public feed. Common reasons include:
        </p>
<ul>
<li>the source doesn’t include it for that aircraft or region</li>
<li>the aircraft is outside good receiver coverage</li>
<li>the data is filtered or delayed</li>
<li>the aircraft is not broadcasting it consistently</li>
</ul>
<h2>“Ident” and other terms you might hear</h2>
<p>
          Controllers can ask a pilot to press an <b>IDENT</b> button, which can briefly highlight the aircraft on a controller’s display.
          That’s different from changing a squawk code. Public trackers don’t always show IDENT events.
        </p>
<h2>A note on accuracy</h2>
<p>
          Live flight data can be delayed, incomplete, or filtered depending on coverage and source rules.
          FlightsAboveMe is designed for curiosity and learning — not for operational decision‑making.

<h2 style="margin-top:0">Quick questions</h2>
<h3>Does a weird squawk mean a problem?</h3>
<p>Usually no. Many codes are routine or local. The big three emergency codes are the main ones with widely recognized meanings.</p>
<h3>Why don’t you show every squawk code meaning?</h3>
<p>Because most codes don’t have a single public meaning. Showing raw numbers can cause confusion, so we prioritize clarity.</p>
<h3>Can a squawk be incorrect on a tracker?</h3>
<p>Yes. Live feeds can be delayed or incomplete, and not every source includes every field consistently.</p>
